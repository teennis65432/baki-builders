# baki_builders

This Branch contains all updated functions as in splash screen buttons in the drawer (top left drop down menu) and logo of the app

## Getting Started
To get started with this file either clone and copy it into your own android stuido with all the files before hand(flutter and dart)
Once copyed or downloaded files are open in android studio you should be able to run the program and on app version you should see a splash screen before you load into the main menu. (Splash screen is up for debate if we are going to keep or change the image).
